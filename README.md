# windivert-zig

WinDivert for Zig!

## Example

Install the WinDivert binaries [here](https://reqrypt.org/download/WinDivert-2.2.0-A.zip). Then, plop the dynamic library (.dll) and driver (.sys) in `./zig-out/bin` and the static library (.lib) in `./staging`. Finally, run `zig build example` **in an elevated terminal**!

To see the example in action, go the [first website ever](http://info.cern.ch/) in incognito or after cache-clean reloading to see it defaced with bad humor.
